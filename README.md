# AP_Importer
AP Test Score Importer for eSchoolPLUS self hosted instances. Since there is no way currently in eSchoolPLUS to upload AP test score files I created this application to do it.   

---
What you need<br />
1 - Visual Studio <br />
2 - An eSchoolPLUS database<br />
3 - College Board AP test score files you need imported to the database<br />
<br />
Please read the use instructions provided to use the software.
